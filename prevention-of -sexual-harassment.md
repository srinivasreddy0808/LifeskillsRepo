## 1. What Kinds of Behaviour Cause Sexual Harassment?

Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. It can manifest in various ways — some explicit and others subtle but still deeply harmful. Below are the types of behaviors that constitute sexual harassment:

### a. **Verbal Harassment**
- Sexual comments or jokes
- Inappropriate remarks about someone’s appearance, clothing, or body
- Repeatedly asking someone on dates or making romantic advances despite clear rejection
- Making lewd or suggestive noises
- Spreading sexual rumors about a person
- Making threats that have sexual undertones

### b. **Non-Verbal Harassment**
- Staring, leering, or making inappropriate gestures
- Sending sexually explicit texts, emails, or messages
- Displaying sexually suggestive materials (e.g., posters, videos, or screensavers)
- Following or stalking someone in person or online

### c. **Physical Harassment**
- Unwanted touching, hugging, or kissing
- Brushing up against someone intentionally
- Blocking someone’s path to intimidate them
- Sexual assault or attempted sexual assault

### d. **Power-Based Harassment (Quid Pro Quo)**
- Offering career advancement or benefits in exchange for sexual favors
- Threatening demotion or job loss for refusing sexual advances
- Giving preferential treatment to employees based on their willingness to engage in a sexual relationship

### e. **Online or Cyber Harassment**
- Sending unsolicited sexual content through messaging apps or email
- Sharing private images or videos without consent (also known as "revenge porn")
- Harassing someone on social media with sexual comments or threats

**Note**: Sexual harassment can occur between individuals of any gender and does not require a power imbalance to be considered harassment. It is the *unwelcome* and *offensive* nature of the behavior that defines it.

## 2. What Would You Do in Case You Face or Witness Any Incident or Repeated Incidents of Such Behaviour?

Sexual harassment should never be tolerated or ignored. Whether you are directly affected or are a bystander, there are clear steps you can take to respond responsibly and safely.

### If You Are a Victim of Sexual Harassment

#### a. **Document the Incident**
- Write down dates, times, locations, and specific details of each incident.
- Include the names of any witnesses.
- Save any messages, emails, or images as evidence.

#### b. **Clearly Communicate Boundaries (If Safe to Do So)**
- Tell the harasser that their behavior is unwelcome and must stop.
- Use clear language like, *"Please do not touch me,"* or *"Your comments are inappropriate."*

#### c. **Report the Incident**
- Report to your manager, HR department, or a designated sexual harassment officer.
- If your workplace or institution has an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), file a formal complaint.

#### d. **Seek Support**
- Talk to a trusted colleague, friend, or counselor.
- Many organizations provide access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) for emotional support.

#### e. **Know Your Legal Rights**
- In many countries, sexual harassment is illegal and protected under labor and civil rights laws.
- File a complaint with your country's labor board or human rights commission if internal mechanisms fail.

### If You Are a Witness to Sexual Harassment

#### a. **Do Not Ignore the Behaviour**
- Your silence may be interpreted as approval.
- Understand that being a passive bystander enables a toxic culture.

#### b. **Support the Victim**
- Ask the person if they are okay and let them know you’re available to help.
- Offer to accompany them when they report the incident.

#### c. **Speak Up (If Safe)**
- If you feel safe, call out the inappropriate behavior at the moment: *“That comment is not appropriate.”*

#### d. **Report It**
- Even if the victim doesn’t come forward, you can report the behavior to HR or management.
- Anonymous reporting options may be available.
