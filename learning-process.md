# Learning Process  – Detailed Answers

## Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique?  
(Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts)

The Feynman Technique is a powerful learning method where I try to **learn a concept deeply by teaching it in simple language**, as if explaining it to someone who knows nothing about the subject.

The key idea is that if I can’t explain something in simple terms, then I probably don’t understand it well myself. The technique involves identifying knowledge gaps while teaching and then going back to review or research the unclear parts. This method not only tests my knowledge but also strengthens it by forcing me to simplify and internalize complex concepts.

For example, when I learn a programming topic like recursion or SQL window functions, I now try to write or speak it out in plain words as if explaining to a beginner. This forces me to think clearly and understand the concept from the ground up.

## Question 2: What was the most interesting story or idea in the TED talk by Barbara Oakley?  
(Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8)

The most fascinating part of Barbara Oakley’s TED talk was her **personal journey from hating math to becoming an engineering professor**. She talked about how, as a child, she struggled with technical subjects and even joined the army to avoid math. But later, when she decided to learn it seriously, she developed her own strategies—especially by understanding how the brain works.

Her story really impacted me because it proves that **intelligence is not fixed**. She showed that with the right approach, anyone can learn anything, even the subjects they once feared or failed in. She used techniques like **chunking**, **spaced repetition**, and switching between **focused and diffused modes** to master difficult topics.

It inspired me to stop thinking "I'm not good at this" and instead ask, “What method can help me get better at this?” It also made me believe that learning is a **trainable skill**, not a natural-born gift.

## Question 3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

In Barbara Oakley's talk, she explains that the brain uses **two main modes for learning**:

1. **Focused Mode**:  
   This is when I’m fully concentrating on a task—like solving a coding problem, debugging an issue, or studying a new framework. I use logic, memory, and attention in this state. It’s useful for deep work and learning step-by-step processes.

2. **Diffused Mode**:  
   This is a relaxed thinking state. It happens when I’m not actively trying to solve a problem—like when I’m walking, taking a shower, or lying in bed. This mode helps the brain make creative connections and understand the “bigger picture.”

Understanding the difference made me realize that **taking breaks isn't laziness—it’s a part of learning**. I now try to give myself downtime between study sessions so that my brain can process and absorb the concepts subconsciously.

## Question 4: According to the video *Learn Anything in 20 Hours*, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?  
(Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)

The video explains how to **rapidly learn new skills by practicing just 20 hours effectively**. Here are the four essential steps:

1. **Deconstruct the skill**  
   Break the skill into smaller parts. Focus on the most important sub-skills that give the highest payoff.

2. **Learn just enough to self-correct**  
   Don’t try to learn everything at once. Get just enough information to start practicing, and correct your mistakes as you go.

3. **Remove barriers to learning**  
   Eliminate distractions like your phone, noise, or interruptions. Create an environment where focused practice is easy.

4. **Practice at least 20 hours**  
   Commit to practicing regularly and stick to it—even when it feels hard at first. 20 hours of deliberate practice can lead to significant improvement in almost any skill.

This taught me that **discipline and consistency are more important than talent**. I now try to apply this when learning anything new—like a programming language, tool, or even communication skill.

## Question 5: What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

There are several actions I’ve decided to implement to **transform the way I learn**:

- **Use the Feynman Technique regularly**: I’ll practice explaining complex topics in simple language. This helps me identify what I don’t fully understand and forces me to review and learn again.

- **Switch between focused and diffused modes**: Instead of pushing myself for long hours, I’ll study in deep, focused sessions followed by short breaks. This will help me learn faster and retain more.

- **Apply "20-Hour Learning" strategy**: Whenever I start a new topic, I’ll break it down, remove distractions, and give myself at least 20 hours of focused practice to become confident in it.

- **Remove distractions while studying**: I’ll silence notifications, use productivity tools like Freedom or TimeLimit, and keep social media blocked during work hours.

- **Track my time and deep work hours**: Using apps like Boosted, I will track how I spend my study hours and gradually increase my deep work capacity.

- **Use curiosity and joy as drivers**: Instead of learning just to finish tasks, I want to enjoy learning like solving a puzzle or building something meaningful. That mindset shift will keep me motivated.

- **Practice deliberate review and reflection**: After learning something, I’ll summarize it, reflect on how I can apply it, and maybe even teach it to others.

- **Prioritize understanding over speed**: I’ll aim to truly understand concepts before rushing to complete assignments. This will help me become a stronger programmer in the long run.

- **Ask myself questions** like:
  - Where is this concept used?
  - Can I explain it clearly?
  - Can I implement it in code?
  - By when should I complete this?

By doing all this, I’m confident that I’ll learn better, faster, and deeper—and become not just a better student, but also a better developer.
