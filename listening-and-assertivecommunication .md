# Communication Reflection - Listening and Communication Styles

## Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

Based on YouTube videos I watched on active listening, here are the strategies I try to follow:

1. **Pay Full Attention**  
   I focus completely on the speaker and remove distractions. Eye contact helps me stay engaged.

2. **Show That You're Listening**  
   I nod, use expressions, and give small verbal signs like “Okay” or “I see” to show I’m listening.

3. **Avoid Interrupting**  
   I let the speaker finish their thoughts without cutting in, even if I feel like responding quickly.

4. **Ask Clarifying Questions**  
   If I don’t understand something, I politely ask questions like “What do you mean by that?”

5. **Paraphrase and Summarize**  
   I repeat the speaker’s message in my own words to confirm understanding.

6. **Respond Appropriately and Empathetically**  
   I try to acknowledge their emotions and reply with respect, even if I disagree.

## Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

From what I understood of Fisher’s model, reflective listening includes:

1. **Listening Carefully**  
   I focus on the speaker and avoid planning my reply while they are talking.

2. **Mirroring the Message**  
   I repeat or rephrase what the speaker said, to confirm I understood it correctly.

3. **Acknowledging Feelings**  
   I try to recognize the speaker’s emotions and reflect them back—like saying, “You sound really upset.”

4. **Staying Non-Judgmental**  
   I avoid interrupting or giving quick advice, and instead aim to understand first.

5. **Confirming Understanding**  
   I check if I understood correctly by asking, “Is that what you meant?”

6. **Encouraging the Speaker**  
   I use open gestures and tone to make the other person feel safe to continue sharing.

## Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?

Some obstacles I face in my listening process are:

- I get distracted easily, especially when I'm tired or multitasking.
- I tend to jump to conclusions or assume what the other person is going to say.
- Sometimes I start thinking about my reply while the other person is still speaking.
- I interrupt or finish others' sentences without realizing it.
- If the topic doesn’t interest me, my focus drops quickly.
- I sometimes become defensive or start judging before fully understanding the message.

## Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?

To improve my listening skills, I plan to:

- Stay present and focused by removing distractions like mobile phones.
- Practice active listening through nodding, making eye contact, and using small verbal cues.
- Paraphrase and summarize what I hear to confirm my understanding.
- Ask open-ended clarifying questions when needed.
- Control my emotions and avoid interrupting or reacting too fast.
- Take notes during technical discussions and meetings to retain key information.

## Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

I switch to a passive style in situations where:

- I want to avoid conflict or confrontation, especially with superiors.
- I lack confidence or am unsure of my opinion.
- I fear hurting someone’s feelings or being judged.
- In group discussions where others dominate, I sometimes stay quiet.

## Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive communication style in your day-to-day life?

I become aggressive in communication when:

- I feel frustrated, ignored, or disrespected.
- I’m under pressure and want things to be done my way.
- Someone criticizes me unfairly, and I respond out of emotion.
- I lose patience and react instead of thinking first.

## Question 7: When do you switch into Passive-Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?

I notice passive-aggressive tendencies when:

- I feel upset but don’t want to express it directly.
- I give the silent treatment or use sarcasm to express dissatisfaction.
- I avoid direct confrontation but still want to show I’m unhappy.
- I gossip or complain behind someone’s back instead of facing the issue.

## Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive?

Based on videos and reflection, I can make my communication assertive by:

- Using “I” statements to express my feelings and needs without blaming others.  
  Example: *"I feel stressed when deadlines are unclear."*

- Keeping calm, maintaining eye contact, and speaking in a respectful tone.

- Being clear and direct about what I want or need.

- Listening actively and respecting others’ viewpoints.

- Learning to say “No” politely and set healthy boundaries.

- Preparing for difficult conversations ahead of time to stay composed.

- Responding with thought rather than reacting emotionally.
