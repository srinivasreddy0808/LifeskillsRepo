# Atomic Habits & Tiny Habits: Questions and Answers

### 1. Forget big change, start with a tiny habit - BJ Fogg (TEDxFremont)

**Q: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
**A:** The most interesting idea was how BJ Fogg used brushing his teeth as a trigger to do just two push-ups. This simple story showed that big changes don’t have to be overwhelming — starting small builds confidence and momentum. The idea that doing even one push-up or flossing one tooth could lead to lasting habits was surprising and motivating.

### 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg | Core Message (Productivity Game)

**Q: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?**
**A:**

* **B = MAP** stands for **Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt**.
* **M (Motivation):** Your desire to do the behavior.
* **A (Ability):** How easy the behavior is to do.
* **P (Prompt):** A cue or reminder to perform the behavior.

To make a habit easier:

* Make the behavior tiny (increase ability).
* Tie it to an existing habit (strong prompt).
* Don't rely on motivation, focus on ease and triggers.

**Q: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**
**A:** Celebration creates a positive emotional connection with the behavior. It makes your brain associate the new habit with success and joy, reinforcing it with dopamine. This emotion is what makes the habit stick.

### 4. Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results - Atomic Habits by James Clear

**Q: What is the book's perspective about Identity?**
**A:** The book emphasizes that true habit change starts with identity change. Instead of focusing on outcomes, you should aim to become the type of person you want to be. Every small habit you perform is a vote for your desired identity (e.g., “I am a reader” vs. “I want to read more”).

**Q: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**
**A:** To make a habit easier:

* Use the **2-Minute Rule**: scale the habit down to take just 2 minutes.
* Design your environment to make the habit obvious and convenient.
* Reduce friction between you and the behavior.

**Q: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**
**A:** To break a bad habit:

* Increase friction by adding steps (e.g., unplugging your TV).
* Remove cues from your environment (make it invisible).
* Use commitment devices to add consequences to the bad habit.
